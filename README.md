# Things to consider
1. To run this application you need to have git and maven installed in the desired machine to work.
2. Once the project is cloned use mvn clean test spring-boot:run (this will clean the project, run tests and finally run the application).
3. You can test the endpoint by curl; curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/payment/" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"amount\": 100, \"rate\": 1.08, \"term\": 5}"
4. Also is it possible to test the endpoint with swagger; http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
5. It's possible to see the DB at http://localhost:8080/h2-console (user:sa | no password set)
